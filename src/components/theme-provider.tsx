/** Mounted State:
1. We use a local state mounted to track whether the component has been mounted in the client. 
This prevents any rendering on the server side until the client has fully mounted.
2. Return Null Before Mounting:
Before the component is mounted, we return null. 
This means that the server will render the HTML without the <ThemeProvider>, avoiding any discrepancies.
3. Client-Only Behavior:
Once the component mounts, it will display the theme correctly,
ensuring that the rendered output is consistent with the client. */
